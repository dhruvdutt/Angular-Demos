### Git Commands discussed in the MEAN workshop taken at Changa University.

1. `git init` Navigate to your project folder and initialize the project.
2. Work on your project, make files, write code.
3. `git remote add origin [online repository path]` Inform git where the repository exists.
4. `git add .` Add all the files changed to staging area.
5. `git commit -m "message"` Commit the changes with an appropriate message.
6. `git push origin master` Push the code to online repository on GitHub.

**Note**: While using `git clone [online repository path]`, step 3 can be skipped because `git remote origin` is automatically.

*Protip*: You can check existing origins via `git remote -v`.
